# 🥾 Hikes and Trails

Welcome to **Hikes and Trails** — a community of techies who fight burnout by touching grass 🌱.  
We organize spontaneous hikes across scenic routes to reconnect with nature, ourselves, and each other.

## 🧭 What We're About

- **Community first**: Everyone’s welcome — devs, designers, thinkers, walkers.
- **Spontaneity**: No rigid schedules. When the vibe is right, we move.
- **Third place energy**: Not work. Not home. Just vibes.
